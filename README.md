## Project Abstraction
A Machine Learning project to classify all seven different types of blood cell, which are "red blood cell", "difficult", "gametocyte", "trophozoite", "ring", "schizont" and "leukocyte", in images. Using Convolutional Neural Network to classify multiple blood cells in the image. The Neural Network is built using powerful Pytorch machine learning library. The final trained model can accurately classify all the cells inside the given image, with the loss value as low as 0.002  

## Project Details
- Go to the model-training folder to look at the jupyter-notebook file to discover how the model was trained.
- A step-by-step process and explanation about the project can be found in the project-report document..
